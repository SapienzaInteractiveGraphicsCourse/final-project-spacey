# Space Y

The following work presented as the final project for the Interactive Graphics course takes inspiration from the recent space missions and projects being carried out by a number of space organizations around the world. The members of the team *Space Y* share a common interest in space exploration field and therefore decided to apply all what they learned in the Interactive Graphics course to create this multi-mission interactive game.

## Overview

The game consists of two levels which defines two different missions, *Mission Moon* and *Mission Mars*. The two missions are marked with different modeling and environment as well as quite distinct tasks to be carried out by astronauts. The user controls the activities of the astronauts like walking, turning, stopping, grabbing and throwing an object with the help of interactive keys.
