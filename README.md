# Space Y

<mark>The game has been developed as the final project for fulfilment of credits for the *Interactive Graphics course* given by *Prof. Marco Shaerf*, A.Y. 2019-2020. </mark>

The following work takes inspiration from the recent space missions and projects being carried out by a number of space organizations around the world. The members of the team *Space Y* share a common interest in space exploration field and therefore decided to apply all what they learned in the Interactive Graphics course to create this multi-mission interactive game.

## Overview

The game consists of two levels which defines two different missions, *Mission Moon* and *Mission Mars*.

The user controls the activities of the astronauts like walking, turning, stopping, grabbing and throwing, repairing an object with the help of interactive keys.
